-- Adventure works have decided to change the product colour for a few of their products along which with their product size. Following is the information.

select ProductColor,
       case when ProductColor = 'Red' then 'Black'
           when ProductColor = 'NA' then 'Blue'
           when ProductColor = 'Multi' then 'Yellow'
           else ProductColor
           end as NewColor
from products;

alter table products add column NewColor VARCHAR(255);

update products set products.NewColor = case when ProductColor = 'Red' then 'Black'
           when ProductColor = 'NA' then 'Blue'
           when ProductColor = 'Multi' then 'Yellow'
           else ProductColor
